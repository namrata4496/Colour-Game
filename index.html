        <p class="intro">  
            The three additive primary colours are red, green, and blue; this means that, by additively mixing the colours red, green, and blue in varying amounts, almost all other colours can be produced.
            An RGB color value is specified with: rgb(red, green, blue).

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.
            You will be given randomly generated RGB value and you have to guess the colour.<br>
            Happy playing!
